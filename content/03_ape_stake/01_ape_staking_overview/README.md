# Exploring the ApeCoin Staking Contract
In the next resource, we'll be exploring the *ApeCoin staking contract*, designed to boost engagement within the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem. Inspired by community-driven Ape Improvement Proposals (AIP) [21](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-21-staking-process-with-caps-1x-drop-process/5074) and [22](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-22-staking-pool-allocation-reloaded-ecosystem-fund-allocation/5071), ApeCoin staking allows holders to stake their tokens in various pools and earn rewards in the form of ApeCoin. While anyone holding ApeCoin can participate, additional pools offer exclusive rewards for those who own NFTs within the Bored Apes ecosystem.


APE Staking is an exciting way for APE Coin holders to grow their assets while supporting the broader APE ecosystem. If you're familiar with terms like *earning rewards* or *crypto staking*, APE Staking works in a similar way but is tailored specifically for the ApeCoin community.  

In simple terms, **staking** means locking up your APE Coins in a staking pool for a set period. In return, you earn rewards‚Äîtypically in the form of more APE Coins. Think of it as putting your money in a high-interest savings account‚Äîbut instead of a bank, you're working with a decentralized blockchain-based system. üè¶ ‚Üí üåê  

1. **Community-Driven Rewards**  
   APE Staking is designed to reward the vibrant community of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFT holders, as well as general APE Coin investors. Special staking pools and reward structures are tailored to encourage participation and loyalty. üêí  

2. **Strengthening the APE Ecosystem**  
   By staking APE Coins, you're not just earning rewards‚Äîyou‚Äôre also helping to strengthen the ecosystem. Staking adds liquidity and stability to the APE ecosystem, empowering initiatives like decentralized governance and development projects funded by the ApeCoin DAO.  

3. **Access to Exclusive Opportunities**  
   Staking opens doors to perks within the APE ecosystem, such as access to exclusive events, metaverse experiences, and potential future projects powered by ApeCoin.
