NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, have changed how we think about ownership in the digital world. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are all the same, each NFT is unique and can't be replaced with something else. One of the most famous NFT collections is **Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)**. This collection consists of 10,000 unique digital images of apes, each one with different traits. But owning a Bored Ape isn't just about the artwork—it’s about being part of an exclusive community. BAYC owners get special perks, like access to private events and a chance to participate in decisions that shape the future of the ecosystem.

BAYC is more than just a collection of digital art; it’s a gateway into the world of Web3. This is a new era of the internet where users have more control over their online presence and assets. By owning a BAYC NFT, you gain membership to a club that’s involved in exciting projects like the **Otherside** metaverse. NFTs like BAYC show how digital ownership can open up new ways for creators and communities to connect, share, and build together. The success of BAYC has paved the way for a more interactive and decentralized digital world, where your online assets are truly yours.

You can explore the **Bored Ape Yacht Club** collection on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub).

What’s crucial to understand is that owning a piece of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) can give you the opportunity to stake and earn ApeCoin. The aim of this course is to show you how to stake using your BAYC NFTs. Specifically, the **BAYC pool** is one of the most lucrative staking pools, where you can earn up to **10,094 ApeCoin** for each BAYC you hold. For Year 2 (Dec. 12th, 2023 – Dec. 12th, 2024), the total staking pool for BAYC is **24,275,000 ApeCoin**, providing significant rewards for those who participate. This makes BAYC an essential asset for maximizing your ApeCoin staking potential.
