# Exploring the ApeCoin Staking Contract

In the next resource, we'll be exploring the *ApeCoin staking contract*, designed to boost engagement within the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem. Inspired by community-driven Ape Improvement Proposals (AIP) [21](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-21-staking-process-with-caps-1x-drop-process/5074) and [22](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-22-staking-pool-allocation-reloaded-ecosystem-fund-allocation/5071), ApeCoin staking allows holders to stake their tokens in various pools and earn rewards in the form of ApeCoin. While anyone holding ApeCoin can participate, additional pools offer exclusive rewards for those who own NFTs within the Bored Apes ecosystem.

**AIP-21** proposes a staking system where users can stake their ApeCoin along with NFTs from the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) to earn rewards. The rewards come from a liquidity pool and are distributed over a three-year period, funded by the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund.

### Benefits of Staking

1. **Rewards for Participation**  
   Staking ApeCoin allows you to earn additional tokens as a reward for participating in the ecosystem.

2. **Supporting the Ecosystem**  
   By staking your ApeCoin, you're contributing to the growth and stability of the ApeCoin ecosystem.

3. **Exclusive Perks**  
   Stakers may receive access to special events, metaverse experiences, and other opportunities within the ApeCoin ecosystem.

### How Staking Works

When you stake ApeCoin, you pair it with an NFT to access a staking pool. The NFT itself isnâ€™t staked, but it acts as a key to the pool where your ApeCoin is locked. You can sell the NFT, but if you do, the new owner gains the rights to the staked ApeCoin unless you unstake it first.

- You own a BAYC NFT and 1000 ApeCoin. You stake 600 ApeCoin in Staking Pool 2 with your NFT, keeping 400 ApeCoin un-staked.
- If you sell your NFT without unstaking, the buyer gains the 600 staked ApeCoin along with any rewards.
- If you unstake your ApeCoin before selling, the buyer gets only the NFT, and you keep your staked ApeCoin and any rewards earned.

### Using ApeStake.io

ApeCoin Staking is powered by **Horizen Labs** on the official ApeStake.io platform. Through this platform, you can stake your ApeCoin and NFTs to earn rewards and participate in the ApeCoin ecosystem.
