# What is ApeCoin ($APE)?  

Before we get started with Ape Staking, it is best to understand what ApeCoin (APE) is. ApeCoin is a governance and utility token at the heart of the APE ecosystem, created to drive innovation and support the next evolution of web3. It enables its community to build and shape culture in the metaverse through art, gaming, entertainment, and events. As an ERC-20 token, ApeCoin provides a decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives, empowering holders to vote, create, and participate in projects that define the future of blockchain culture.  

Backed by the **APE Foundation**, ApeCoin is governed by the **ApeCoin DAO**, ensuring transparent, decentralized decision-making. Beyond governance, APE offers access to exclusive games, events, and services, while also unifying the ecosystem with a shared currency. With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, ApeCoin is designed to be a sustainable and inclusive tool for collaboration and innovation.
