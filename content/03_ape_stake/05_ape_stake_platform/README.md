# Ape Stake Platform

Now that you understand the process of staking ApeCoin (APE) alongside NFTs like BAYC or MAYC, it's helpful to explore how the Ape Staking platform works. Staking combines ERC-20 tokens (like ApeCoin) with NFTs (like BAYC or MAYC), creating a unique, community-driven approach to earning rewards. Developers can leverage verified contracts, retrieve their ABIs, and interact programmatically using libraries like ethers.js or viem. Detailed guides on method invocation are available in the official documentation.

*To use the staking platform, visit the official app at https://app.apestake.io. Be cautious and double-check the URL, as incorrect or malicious platforms can result in asset loss. As of 2024, this is the correct URL, but it may change in the future.*

Here you can have four different ways of staking, from the $APE coin to the Ape NFTs. The Ape Staking platform simplifies earning rewards by allowing users to stake ApeCoin (APE) and NFTs like BAYC, MAYC, and BAKC through a user-friendly interface that abstracts complex blockchain interactions. With four staking options—APE-only, BAYC, MAYC, or BAKC paired with BAYC/MAYC—users can manage multiple assets, claim rewards, and withdraw funds seamlessly.
